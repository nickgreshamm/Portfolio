## Introduction

The renewable energy transition has resulted in the introduction of many energy generation/storage options to the market. A key market to be taken advantage of in this space is a deployable solar array which can be used to intermittently power worksites. The currently viable deployable options in the space however are often too small to power anything significant (~1kW) or too large to deploy quickly with a small team. The intention of the solar array project was to provide a medium sized array ~20kW which could be deployed within an hour using a team of 2-3 workers.

## Solution

The final 3D model of extended and retracted array can be seen below.

### Process

There were many stages of development through this project which extended from design ideation, through to development, three dimensional modelling, drawing production and eventual manufacturing. The following images make up a snap shot of my development process.

### Improvement to mechanical design 

The original design used multiple tapping screws and hinges housed within a single box section, which housed 8mm bolts serving as an axle with an attached bearing. This served as the base on which the array extended. However, the design was overly complex, making assembly difficult and time-consuming, while also limiting the array's technical capabilities. The first prototype failed after just one use due to a weak axle design.

To address these issues, I introduced a novel solution by redesigning the system to incorporate both the housing and the hinge into a single, robust component surrounding a central 20mm axle. The wheels of the array were mounted directly onto this axle, enhancing stability. Prior to my design alterations, the fully contracted width of the 30kW array was 3548mm; this was reduced to 1980mm, significantly boosting the production capacity of the array from 14.4kW to 21.6kW.

## Project Summary and Professional Development

As with my work at ESI, this project was very multi-disciplinary and I had to demonstrate a full range of my skills as both an engineer and designer. The project challenged me to design the mechanisms by which it was deployed and retracted, its transportability, and electrical componentry and configurtion.  The success in improving the array's technical capacity demonstrates my ability to innovate within the renewable energy sector. As a whole, through communication with team members and clients, this project has honed my communication and project management skills, preparing me for future challenges in sustainable technology development.
