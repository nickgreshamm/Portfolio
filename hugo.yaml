My primary focus was leading the design of a first-to-market mobile 22kW solar array, developed to pair with XCEL's xt-alpha energy storage solution.

<p> My key achievements at Xcel Tech Include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transitioning their original stationary solar array design, into a fully portable system mounted on an 8x5 trailer.</li>
  <li>Increasing the system's capability from 14kW to 22kW without increasing its physical size and eliminating the need for heavy machinery during its deployment.</li>
  <li>Expanding Xcel's digital fabrication capabilities to include SLA and FDM 3D printing, as well as CNC machining and a 130W laser cutter.</li>
</ul>

<p>This work significantly advanced XCEL Tech's product offerings. [More on this in Projects.]</p>"

        content: |
          I began working at ESIAP as an intern at the end of 2022. ESIAP worked in transitioning iron flow battery (IFB) technology into the Australian market through their partnership with the inventors of large scale IFBs, Electrical Storage Solutions (ESS) Inc. 
          
          <p> My roles at ESIAP included:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Initially working as an intern, focusing on testing and commissioning Australia's first IFBs, developing a deep understanding of their operation, including charge time, round trip efficiency, and maintenance cycles.</li>
            <li>Leveraging my learnings to transition into the role of sole mechanical design engineer for ESIAP's next generation IFBs.</li>
          </ul>
          
          The work I completed as a mechanical design engineer formed the basis of my honours thesis, which was selected to represent the school of Medical and Mechanical and Process Engineering at QUT's 2023 Engineering showcase. More details on these projects can be found in the Projects section.
