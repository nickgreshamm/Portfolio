        content: "I began working at XCEL Tech through my final semester of university. At XCEL Tech, I was involved in several important projects for both clients and the company. My primary focus was leading the design of a first-to-market mobile 22kW solar array, developed to pair with XCEL's xt-alpha energy storage solution. I transitioned the original stationary design, which required groundwork, into a fully portable system mounted on an 8x5 trailer. The design I created eliminated the need for heavy machinery during deployment and reduced the original designs overall footprint by 50%. This work significantly improved upon XCEL's first-generation solar array, which only housed 2kW. More on this in Projects."

        content: |
          I began working at ESIAP as an intern at the end of 2022. ESIAP worked in transitioning iron flow battery (IFB) technology into the Australian market through their partnership with the inventors of large scale IFBs, Electrical Storage Solutions (ESS) Inc. My roles at ESIAP included:
          - Initially working as an intern, focusing on testing and commissioning Australia's first IFBs, developing a deep understanding of their operation, including charge time, round trip efficiency, and maintenance cycles.
          - Transitioning into the role of sole mechanical engineer for ESIAP's next generation IFBs.

          The work I completed as a mechanical design engineer formed the basis of my honours thesis, which was selected to represent the school of Medical and Mechanical and Process Engineering at QUT's 2023 Engineering showcase.

          More details on these projects can be found in the Projects section.
