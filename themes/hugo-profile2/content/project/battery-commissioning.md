## Introduction

My first role at ESIAP was my first in the professional engineering space. Given the size of ESIAP at the time, I was required to wear many hats and my primary job was to sift through battery testing data and prepare reports for my superior. Before my arrival at ESIAP, this work was done by a single person who was manually scrubbing excel data to better understand the behaviour of the batteries. This work was not overly difficult, but extremley tedious. I streamlined the analytical process by writing Python scripts to automate data cleaning and analysis, using Jupyter Notebooks to generate the necessary graphs for review with my superior. 

During first role at ESIAP I also worked with stakeholder engagment and took part in meetings with potential clients to discuss the feasibility of their battery storage projects. This included Stanwell coorporation, a government owned energy company which were developing a Future Energy Innovation and Training Hub (FEITH) to accelerate Queensland’s energy transformation.

## Commissioning and Testing

When the batteries first arrived in brisbane they were completley non functional and required testing and commissioning. This was a huge task as the batteries were the first of their kind to be installed in Australia and there was no guidence on how to test or commission them. I was tasked to work alongside ESS engineers to figure out how the best operate the batteries. One of the primary tasks we undertook was to charge the battery to full capacity and assess its round trip efficiency, when discharged at various rates. Through this process we learnt alot and our learning culminiated in the first batteries being deployed to be apart a twenty unit system at Stanwells rockhampton power station to form 1MW/10MWh of energy storage – the first iron flow battery in Australia and the largest in the world.

## Project Summary and Professional Development

The work at ESIAP had a significant impact on my professional development by enhancing my technical skills in data analysis and automation through Python, as well as providing hands-on experience in commissioning cutting-edge energy storage technologies. Additionally, collaborating with industry stakeholders, including Stanwell Corporation, improved my communication and project management abilities, preparing me for more complex roles in the renewable energy sector.
